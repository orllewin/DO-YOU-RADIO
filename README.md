# DO!! YOU!!! RADIO

Unofficial Android app for Charlie Bones [DO!! YOU!!! RADIO](https://doyou.world/). I knocked this up over an evening or so before there was a working official app. No patterns to speak of, but it's a small decent bit of software and illustrates [streaming audio in a foreground service](https://github.com/orllewin/DO-YOU-RADIO/blob/main/app/src/main/java/orllewin/doyouworld/RadService.kt).
